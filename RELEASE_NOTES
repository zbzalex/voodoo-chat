RELEASE NOTES for 0.09.20


You need to read this only if you're using already Voc-engine (previous version) with your own design-files.

Some changes in the designes: 
DESIGN/index.php -- now it contains name-attribute for the second frame (voc_shower) 
DESIGN/welcome.php contains drop-down menu for the room 
DESIGN/who.php contains the form to change the room

DESIGN/daemon_html_header.html 
It should contain Javascript function up(). 
Just copy the script from 'sky' or 'default' scheme. 
I've introduced this to reduce the traffic (<script>up()</script> is shorter than <script>scroll(1,1000000)</script>) and this function also can be used to monitor status (if there are no calling of this function for long time, we can let user know that he is disconnected. I will include such code later) 

DESIGN/daemon_html_header.html 
also contains special directive [TOPIC] which will be replaced with current room's topic in output.
